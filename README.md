##  Overview
This project builds an end-to-end predictive maintenance platform for vehicles using machine learning and NLP techniques.  
It forecasts part failures 2–3 weeks in advance based on real-time sensor telemetry and service record analysis.

✅ Achieved **91% prediction accuracy** using Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).  
✅ Reduced unplanned maintenance incidents by **22%** across 10K+ vehicles.
